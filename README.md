# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
PyBer has hired me to create a summary DataFrame of their ride-sharing data by city type. 

1. Determine the number of riders by city type.
2. Determine the number of drivers by city type.
3. Determine the total fare per city type.
4. Determine the average fare per driver for each city type.
5. Create and cleanup a summary dataframe of the above data.
6. Create a line chart displaying the total fares each week by city type.

## Challenge Overview

### Overview of School District Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to determine whether and how the academically dishonest data from Thomas High School affected the math and reading scores for the school district.

## Resources
-Data Source:city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
-Software: Python 3.7.13, Jupyter Notebook 6.4.12, Anaconda 2.2.0

## Results
Comparing each city type, I found that:
  Total Rides:
    -Urban: 1625
    -Suburban: 625
    -Rural: 125
  Total Drivers:
    -Urban: 2405
    -Suburban: 490
    -Rural: 78
  Average Fare per Ride:
    -Urban: $24.53
    -Suburban: $30.97
    -Rural: $34.62
  Average Fare per Driver:
    -Urban: $16.57
    -Suburban: $39.50
    -Rural: $55.49

## Summary

As can be seen from the data, there are more rides and drivers in total in more urban areas. However, the average fare per ride and per driver is higher in rural areas. This data fits with my natural intuition. As more urban areas have more people, it is expected there would be more rides and more drives as there is a greater population to draw upon. Further, it is likely that a ride in more rural areas must go a longer distance which would explain the greater average cost. I have three recommendations that should help fix these disparities. First, engage in more aggressive hiring of drivers in rural and suburban areas. With more drivers, the cost per ride should come down resulting in more rides taken. Second, add congestion pricing. By charging more as more people use PyBer, urban price per ride should increase which would help fix this disparity. Finally, subsidize rural fares. By subsidizing rural fares, we can bring down the cost per rider and increase our market share without alienating our drivers.
